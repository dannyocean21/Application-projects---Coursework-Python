# Why do we need NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib
# When in python we need to analyze the big data or do something mathematical
# Standard Python is not really efficient.
# Here those libraries will help us

# * Numpy - Numerical Python
# Why? - for fast mathematical operations with massive data (list of data) and matrices
# For effective work with многомерными данными
# Linear algenra and statistics

# Example of usage
#1. Data science: do quantity analysis based on big data
#2. Machine learning: create and process massive data
#3. Process the signals: use the mathematical преобразования

# Pandas (Python Data Anaysis Library)
# Why do we need it, to process the table format data (For example, table in Excel).
# Dataframe

# Matplotlib
