## **1. Alpha Edu – 1st Half (Python Programming Content)**

**Description:**  
This folder contains the course material I attended outside of school. The first half focuses on **basic Python programming**, covering topics such as:

- Python fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals)
- Functions and modules
- Data structures (lists, tuples, dictionaries)
- Basic I/O operations
- Simple exercises and practice problems

**Contents:**  
Files in this folder contain lecture notes, exercises, and examples demonstrating core Python concepts.

## **2. Alpha Edu – 2nd Half (Python Programming Content)**

**Description:**  
This folder continues from the first half and introduces **more advanced Python concepts**, including the use of **AI and machine learning packages**. Topics include:

- NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib for data manipulation and visualization
- Introduction to machine learning concepts
- Implementing basic AI algorithms in Python
- Practice exercises integrating AI packages

**Contents:**  
Files here are course notes and exercises with Python scripts applying AI and ML libraries.

## **3. Final Project – Stock Price Prediction**

**Description:**  
This folder contains my **final project** for the Python programming course. It is a **Stock Price Prediction script** implemented using:

- Yahoo Finance API for fetching stock data
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network for prediction
- Data scaling with `MinMaxScaler`
- Visualization using `Matplotlib`

**Contents:**  
- `Final project.py`: The full Python script for fetching stock data, training an LSTM model, predicting future prices, and plotting results.  
  ⚠️ **Note:** This script does not include any datasets. It fetches live stock data from Yahoo Finance.

## **4. Machine Learning Projects**

**Description:**  
This folder contains homework assignments and exercises related to machine learning. These are mostly practice exercises from my studies, implementing ML algorithms such as:

- Regression (linear, polynomial)
- Classification (k-NN, decision trees)
- Clustering (k-means)
- Model evaluation and visualization

**Contents:**  
- Python scripts and notebooks demonstrating ML concepts and practical applications.

## **5. Python Programming Projects**

**Description:**  
This folder contains **simple Python exercises** I found online and solved for practice. It is focused on improving Python skills and includes:

- Small coding challenges
- Fun projects (like games, calculators)
- Algorithmic exercises and data manipulation tasks

**Contents:**  
- Python scripts (`.py`) for each exercise

---

## **6. SQL Data and Movie Dataset**

**Description:**  
This folder contains **SQL datasets** and related scripts. These are from my studies in Poland as an exchange student, used as a recap of SQL concepts. It contains:

- Movie and sales datasets
- SQL scripts to perform queries and data manipulation

**Contents:**  
- `.sql` scripts with various queries
- `.csv` or dataset files

---

## **7. SQL Operations and Visualization (Movie and Sales Data)**

**Description:**  
This folder contains exercises and scripts for **performing SQL operations** on the movie and sales data. It also includes visualizations of the results using Python or other tools.

**Contents:**  
- SQL scripts (`.sql`) for queries like joins, aggregations, filtering
- Python scripts or notebooks for visualizations

## **Navigation Tips**

1. Start with the **Alpha Edu folders** if you want to go from beginner to advanced Python concepts.  
2. Explore the **Python Programming Projects** for simple exercises to practice coding.  
3. Move to **Machine Learning Projects** to see implementations of ML algorithms.  
4. The **Final Project – Stock Price Prediction** demonstrates a full-scale project combining Python and AI.  
5. Finally, explore **SQL Data and SQL Operations** folders to practice database operations and visualizations.

## **Notes**

- Most Python scripts are **ready-to-run**. Some may require installing libraries such as:
  ```bash
  pip install numpy pandas matplotlib tensorflow scikit-learn yfinance
